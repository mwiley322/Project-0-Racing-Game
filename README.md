# Racing Game
This game synthesized all the knowledge I acquired over the past two weeks, plus let me have a little fun with animations and keyup functions. This game allows 2 players to move either Sully or Mike W. from Monsters, Inc. across the browser to compete for the win!

I wanted to give both characters the look of "running," and toggleClass was the closest I got! I originally had a much larger operation that turned the classes on and off, and then I found out about the toggle.

## Planned Features
- Add music
- Keep track of score
- A more mobile-friendly experience
